  abstract  = {Unbranded palm cooking oil has been fortified for several years and can be found in the market with different oxidation levels. This study aimed to investigate the stability and shelf life of unbranded, bulk, vitamin A-fortified palm oils with the most commonly observed oxidation levels in Indonesia. Three types of cooking oils were tested: (i) cooking oil with a peroxide value (PV) below 2 mEq O2/kg (PO1); (ii) cooking oil with a PV around 4 mEq O2/kg (PO2); and (iii) cooking oil with a PV around 9 mEq O2/kg (PO3). The oil shelf life was determined by using accelerated shelf life testing (ASLT), where the product was stored at 60, 75 and 90 °C, and then PV, free fatty acid and vitamin A concentration in the oil samples were measured. The results showed that PO1 had a shelf life of between  2–3 months, while PO2’s shelf life was a few weeks and PO3’s only a few days. Even given those varying shelf lives, the vitamin A loss in the oils was still acceptable, at around 10%. However, the short shelf life of highly oxidized cooking oil, such as PO3, might negatively impact health, due to the potential increase of free radicals of the lipid peroxidation in  the oil. Based on the results, the Indonesian government should prohibit the sale of  highly-oxidized cooking oil. In addition, government authorities should promote and endorse the fortification of only cooking oil with low peroxide levels to ensure that fortification is not associated with any health issues associated with high oxidation levels of the cooking oil.},

  abstract  = {Characterizations of fatty acids composition in % of total methylester of fatty acids (FAMEs) of fourteen vegetable oils—safflower, grape, silybum marianum, hemp, sunflower, wheat germ, pumpkin seed, sesame, rice bran, almond, rapeseed, peanut, olive, and coconut oil—were obtained by using gas chromatography (GC). Saturated (SFA), monounsaturated (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), palmitic acid (C16:0; 4.6%–20.0%), oleic acid (C18:1; 6.2%–71.1%) and linoleic acid (C18:2; 1.6%–79%), respectively, were found predominant. The nutritional aspect of analyzed oils was evaluated by determination of the energy contribution of SFAs (19.4%–695.7% ERDI), PUFAs (10.6%–786.8% ERDI), n-3 FAs (4.4%–117.1% ERDI) and n-6 FAs (1.8%–959.2% ERDI), expressed in % ERDI of 1  g oil to energy recommended dietary intakes (ERDI) for total fat (ERDI—37.7 kJ/g). The significant relationship between the reported data of total fat, SFAs, MUFAs and PUFAs intakes (% ERDI) for adults and mortality caused by coronary heart diseases (CHD) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in twelve countries has not been confirmed by Spearman’s correlations.},

Se concluyó que la ingestión de pescados de carne azul 2 o 3 veces por semana, es una recomendación dietética para toda la población y que el consumo de aceites de pescado en dosis moderadas (hasta 3 g al día), es beneficioso para los diabéticos, hipertensos e hipertrigliceridémicos como tratamiento coadyuvante, que además disminuye la agregación plaquetaria y reduce la síntesis de mediadores químicos de la inflamación. Dosis elevadas de aceites de pescado pueden resultar perjudiciales sobre el control glucémico, la hipertensión arterial en personas susceptibles y los niveles séricos de lipoproteínas de baja densidad (LDL) y lipoproteínas de alta densidad (HDL).<br>A review was made on the beneficial and detrimental effect of omega-3 fatty acids in subjects with diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension and dislipidaemias, as well as on their effects on homeostasis and other organs and systems. It was concluded that the intake of blue meat fish 2 or 3 times a week is a dietary recommendation for the whole population and that the consumption of fish oil at moderate doses (up to 3g a day) is beneficial for patients suffering from diabetes, arterial hypertension and hypertriglyceridemia as a coadjuvant treatment. It also reduces platelet aggregation and the synthesis of the chemical mediators of inflammation. Elevated doses of fish oil may be harmful for glucemic control and arterial hypertension in sensitive persons and for the serum levels of low density lipoproteins (LDL) and high level lipoproteins (HDL).},
